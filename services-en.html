                        <h2>PPF - Paint Protection Film</h2>
                        Paint Protection Film (PPF) is a polyurethane material that constitutes the most
                        durable type of paint protection available on the market. This solution is
                        characterized by extremely long durability, lasting up to 10 years (with a
                        5-year installation guarantee). Protecting a car with PPF is especially
                        dedicated to those who have invested significantly in new cars and wish to
                        safeguard the vehicle against significant depreciation.

                        </p>
                        <p>
                            We offer the latest series from renowned brands like 3M and STEK, which have
                            self-healing properties, are anti-yellowing, and have a thickness of 200 microns
                            (compared to the original paint layers which typically have between 70-100
                            microns). PPF film provides complete protection against rock chip damage and
                            scratches with its self-healing technology and can be applied to a variety of
                            surfaces, including cars, boats, trucks, car interiors, and more.

                        <h2>Ceramic Coating</h2>
                        <p>
                            Thanks to our outstanding market products, continuously updated and recognized
                            worldwide for their durable properties, as well as our best-selling product line
                            with a duration of 36 months/40,000 km, we can undoubtedly stand behind the
                            quality of our services.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The ceramic coating contributes to protecting the paint in several ways.
                            Firstly, it has hydrophobic properties that repel water from the bodywork,
                            allowing it to bead and roll off. This feature also makes it harder for
                            pollutants to adhere to the surface. The coating also enhances the depth of the
                            paint, giving the car a brilliant and glassy appearance. Furthermore, the
                            ceramic coating makes the paint more resistant to UV radiation, preventing
                            fading over time.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The quality of the ceramic coating and the application process play a crucial
                            role in the outcome. Our products are internationally renowned for their gloss
                            and hydrophobic properties, and our ceramic coating is classified with a 9H
                            hardness. This coating is applied by experienced and certified professionals,
                            and the best results are achieved through proper preparation of the car's paint
                            and multiple steps of polishing and paint correction.

                        <p>
                            Paint correction is a process that selectively removes swirl marks, scratches,
                            and other defects from the car's paint. The aim of this treatment is to
                            eliminate imperfections and restore the paint to its original condition. With
                            us, as well as with other professional specialists, three types of paint
                            correction are offered: One-Step, 2-step, and 3-Step. The latter, known as full
                            paint correction, is used on the most demanding surfaces. It allows us to remove
                            up to approximately 90% of scratches, and after the treatment, the car appears
                            highly presentable under all lighting and weather conditions.

                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The choice of the right method should be left to the specialists treating the
                            vehicle. We professionally consider each car and conduct a thorough inspection
                            of the condition and thickness of the paint before starting the polishing.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            After such treatment, aiming to achieve maximum and best possible results while
                            protecting the car in the long run, we would gladly recommend considering our
                            paint protection service for further security and maintenance.

                        <p>

                            Enhance your truck's paint with our advanced ceramic paint coating. Resist dirt,
                            road salt, harmful UV rays, and weather impact while maintaining a brilliant and
                            reflective surface. Ceramic coatings not only have protective properties but
                            also reduce the adhesion of snow, ice, and water to the bodywork due to their
                            hydrophobic properties. Corrosion, the main cause of rust occurrence and spread,
                            is damage and oxidation. The ceramic coating minimizes the risk of both. We
                            recommend that the customer returns for a brief check-up or possibly a spa wash
                            appointment after a year or when the winter season is over.

                            pristine condition. In addition, we also offer unique graphic tasks, tuning of
                            stripes and logos, and the opportunity to create your dream design through full
                            car wrapping, vehicle wrapping, or color change. We also recommend providing
                            full protection to your truck by choosing the PPF package - either for the most
                            exposed areas or for the entire front.

                            Durability: The film comes with a manufacturer's warranty of 8 years, but in
                            reality, UV exposure is likely to cause some breakdown around 4-5 years. We
                            provide a 2-year warranty, as we cannot accurately predict how well it is
                            maintained by the customer.

                        <p>Enjoy a fresh and inviting vehicle interior through our comprehensive interior cleaning. We
                            thoroughly remove dust, stains, pet hair, and odors. The interior is filled with a natural
                            and pleasant scent that our customers appreciate. We offer machine washing of the entire
                            interior, including headliners and floors, protection of plastic elements against harmful UV
                            rays, use of PPF film for extra protection, cleaning, and conditioning of leather seats.</p>
                        <p>We have extensive knowledge of repairing leather seats in car, boat interiors, and furniture.
                            We are careful to identify the material we are working with, as not all leather variants are
                            the same. Incorrect cleaning and preservation agents can lead to costly damage, so we take
                            extra care to ensure optimal treatment and preserve the quality of the interior.</p>

                        <p>Take your leisure boat or yacht to new heights with our advanced Marine Coating! We introduce
                            a revolutionary new ceramic coating tailored for gel coating and the entire surface of your
                            boat that comes into contact with water for extended periods.</p>
                        <p>Marine Ceramic Coat is based on the same technology we use for our other premium ceramic
                            coatings. Your yacht will be protected against harsh weather conditions. In our tests in the
                            demanding Norwegian waters, the ship's hull remained intact for a full 2 seasons after the
                            application of 2 coats of coating.</p>
                        <p>Gelcoat is more susceptible to oxidation and contamination than traditional car paint due to
                            its porosity. To prevent this, it needs extra, reliable protection, which is provided by
                            Marine Ceramic Coat.</p>
                        <p>Thanks to Marine Ceramic Coat, you will forget about oil stains on the hull and enjoy the
                            beautiful shine and color depth of your boat. You get excellent protection against
                            oxidation, weather conditions, algae, and harmful UV radiation at no extra cost. If you need
                            leather seat repair or painting, feel free to contact us to discuss further.</p>
